# Hellrift

This game is my entry to the Duck Sauce Games 2025 Game Jam. The theme for this jam was Rift. The game is built in the Godot Engine.

This game is a multiplayer, 1v1 2D platformer in which an angel and a demon must fight. Heaven and Hell have been connected by the interdimensional rift in the middle of the screen, which constantly rotates. The angel is safe while in Heaven, and the demon is safe in Hell, but both are vulnerable while in the other's domain. Keep up with the rotation of the rift to stay safe, and attack your opponent when they're vulnerable.
